# Welcome to Platforms!

## Welcome!

We are on a mission to empower developers at digital-native companies to improve cloud operations, maintain security, control cost, and ensure governance of ever-growing cloud estate. If you’re reading this document, it means you have decided to join us on this journey!

This guide has some basic information to get you started but it’s far from being an exhaustive list of everything you might need. Please don’t be afraid to ask questions, our goal as a team is to provide you with great onboarding experience!

## Our Values

They are few, but we feel strongly about them. From creating processes to decision-making and recruiting, we build our five core values into nearly every single thing we do.

* **Independence**. Others can trust that you’ll deliver on time and your teammates don’t need to worry about you keeping your word.
* **Mastery**. You love what you do and care deeply about the quality of your work, down to the smallest details.
* **Communication**. Your communication is clear, concise, and engaging whether you're explaining a complex idea or providing feedback.
* **Ambition**. You set high standards for yourself and those around you. The time you spend on work isn’t measured by quantity, but by quality.
* **Impact**. You're able to see the "big picture" and then solve issues that have a high impact on our customers, our team, and our company.

## Craft your ideal work environment

We understand this maybe the first time you are working from home. Here is a short list of curated resources we recommend you to review from time to time:

* [https://doist.com/blog](https://doist.com/blog)
* [https://basecamp.com/remote-resources](https://basecamp.com/remote-resources)

During your first three months, you will have an access to US$1,000 budget to cozy up your home office! You can use this budget for upgrading your desk, buying an ergonomic chair and anything else that makes you productive! Use [go/expenses](http://go/expenses) to submit your first expense report!

## Our Org Chart

The Cloud Management Platform we are building has 5 pillars: Analytics, Governance, Enablement, Productivity and Optimization. Each pillar has its own team and each team has Staff Software Engineer \(SWSE\), Software Engineers \(SWE\), Product Manager and a few other functions varying from team to team.

As an engineer, you will be assigned to one of our pillar teams so you could develop a deep understanding and expertise in a certain area in the product. Here is a brief mission statement for each team.

* **Analytics & Billing**: get an accurate view of multi-cloud spend no matter how complex the cloud infrastructure is.
* **Governance**: policy-based governance capabilities to ensure compliance through automated remedial actions, and a greater ability to integrate with external tooling
* **Optimization**: Address the ballooning cloud cost using a reactive approach and achieve sustainable cost reduction, using an automated approach, embraced by the developers and cloud architects.
* **Productivity**: Provide data analysts and engineers with best web based IDE for cloud-native databases.
* **Enablement**: Empower our customers to achieve more with Cloud Management Platform by building self-service functionality and “productizing” some of our Cloud Engineering team.
* **Core** - Establish solid and robust foundations crossing the domain boundaries of Cloud Management Platform.

## Slack Communication Channels

As a remote-first company, we rely on Slack, email, Google Meet and few other communication channels. Please join the following Slack channels on doitintl.slack.com workspace:

* [\#team-platforms](https://doitintl.slack.com/archives/CL6932A5S) \(team’s channel\)
* [\#cmp-release-notes](https://doitintl.slack.com/archives/C01865K3ACU) \(internal announcements of new features\)
* [\#cmp-devops](https://doitintl.slack.com/archives/CHW0WM8P3) \(our CI/CD channel\)

**Optional channels to watch**

* \#winwire \(new sales contracts announcements\)
* \#engineering \(used mainly by Cloud Reliability Engineering team\)
* \#satisfaction \(support ticket customer satisfaction ratings\)

## Adhere to our Engineering Best Practices

We have generalized certain engineering practices that cover the languages we use in our projects. This curated list represents our collective experience of various best practices that we have developed over time.

We recommend that you review these practices during your first week and refresh your knowledge of them from time to time.

Read more \(and bookmark!\) at [https://app.gitbook.com/@doitintl/s/eng-practices](https://app.gitbook.com/@doitintl/s/eng-practices)

## Development Process

Login to Asana and make sure to set up your full name and Avatar to make it easier for others to communicate with you. You will find under the board section an Asana board per each product domain \(“Core”, “A&B”, “Enablement”, “Optimization”, etc.\)

Each of the boards will have a task name and status column such as “Developing This Week”, “QA/Review” or “Done”.

Once a task is assigned to you, please do the following:

* See that you understand what you need to do
* Once you start the task move it to "Developing this Week" column
* In GitHub Repo open a feature/hotfix branch per the type of tasks you were assigned to.
* Branch names should follow this convention: feature/emailName/featureDescritpion. For example for Tal Cohen \([talc@doit-intl.com](mailto:talc@doit-intl.com)\) it will be “feature/talc/cloudConnect” or “hotfix/emailName/hotfixDescription”
* Once you complete your task move the task to the QA/Review column and open a PR which should be assigned to your manager or colleague for review
* During QA when your branch is being deployed make sure to post a link to your PR into the build thread on Slack \([\#cmp-devops](https://doitintl.slack.com/archives/CHW0WM8P3)\) for visibility
